                    <p class="description">
                        Students implement best practices of object-oriented program development with
                        software design patterns. Students also apply Unified Modeling Language (UML) program
                        specifications in the Java programming language. SQL through JDBC technology is used embedded
                        for developing and using "data access objects". Course topics include refactoring, domain
                        modelling, JDBC and multithreaded servlet programming. Students develop proficiency in creating,
                        testing, debugging, deploying and documenting programs and servlets through practical
                        application.

                        Students create COBOL programs in a business environment using structured methodology in the
                        latest visual programming environment. Topics include output design, logic design tools,
                        structured, top-down and modular coding, testing and debugging, and documentation. Students
                        examine
                        interactive, file-based, and database processing of data related to business problems. Arrays,
                        indexed files,
                        database access and sub-programs are explored.

                        The foundation underlying this process is the Data Analytics that explore the data, identify the
                        relationships and patterns in a meaningful way. Students examine the components and best
                        practices of BI
                        technology, and how it guides operational to strategic business decisions in the context of
                        real-world
                        applications. Data analytics techniques are used to derive insight using statistical software to
                        provide insight
                        into patterns and trends not immediately obvious in the raw data.

                        reports.
                        The culmination of the course is a final presentation and technical review, followed by the
                        delivery of the finished product.
